# Instructions 

Create a simple app that routes audio from an oscillator through multiple gain nodes and changes the routing dynamically. The destination property of AudioContext defines where all processed audio is ultimately sent for playback.

Make a new directory with your name like in the example folder my_name.

## Goals

- Experiment with directing the audio signal flow 
- Control the audio graph with using a toggle routing interface
- Practice interchanging the nodes in the routing chain, also with audio buffer as well.

- Bonus goal: Add visual feedback for active routing paths (e.g. connected/disconnected lines)

## Tips

- same as for audio synthesis exercise
- start with simple GainNodes (other effects and modulations later)
- don't forget to disconnect node before updating
- add active class to nodes in use like ` document.getElementById('yourNodeId').classList.add('active')`
